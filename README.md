# cash

"Greedy" algorithm. Exercise for CS50.

Given a certain amount to be owed in change, the program calculates the total number of coins to be returned, going from the higher coin (quarters, 0.25) to the lowest (cents, 0.01).

For example, if the user is owed 0.26 cents, the program will output a total of 2 coins: 1 of 0.25 + 1 of 0.01.

Likewise, if the amount owed is 0.41 cents, the program will output a total of 4 coins: 1 of 0.25 + 1 of 0.10 + 1 of 0.05 + 1 of 0.01.
